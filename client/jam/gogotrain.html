  Go! Go! Dave Train! is an arcade-like train simulator, where you assume the
  role of engineer.  The aim is to arrive at your destination platform in a
  timely manner while staying under the speed limits.

  One of the main features and attractions of Dave Train is the HUD.  Signals
  for speed changes appear on your in-dash display.  Acceleration speeds and
  braking power are printed out in 7-segment LED displays.  An analog-style
  clock counts down how much time you have left to make it to your destination,
  and another digital display shows how much distance you still have to cover.

  Considerable attention was given to the sound in Dave Train.  The hiss and
  mechanical clatter as the train prepares for departure, the rising hum of
  the takeoff, the rhythm of progress.  These purposeful sounds form the
  game's secondary, visceral interface.  In harmony with the beautiful,
  discrete visuals, the game's audio forms an attractive and understandable
  world.

  I must also hint at the game's final stage.  It is certainly surprising,
  extremely different from the normal mode of gameplay, and also very funny.
  The initial foreshadowing and then the wild loss of control give the
  experience of a classic adventure film.  If I could (greedily) ask anything
  of the already excellent Dave Train, it would be for more thrills like this!

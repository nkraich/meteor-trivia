  Noname is a platform game where you become the Head Ninja, Noname.  In case
  you thought the game was simply untitled, know that Noname is pronounced
  "No-nah-mi".  And anyway, Untitled is your sweety's name.  Yes, your sweety.
  And she's been captured by the villain!

  To save her, you must run, jump, and fly through a variety of
  platformer-style levels.  Although crudley rendered, and making extensive use
  of often-clashing clipart, Noname presents a number of creative challenges.
  Make your way through a few typical platform levels, and you soon find
  yourself flying through the sky in the arms of a vampire, deflecting
  attackers with a shield.

  Noname is a very funny game.  It's definitely a parody of (bad) video games,
  and perhaps even a parody of game development itself.  At certain points, it
  seems very aware of the corners it's cutting.  I think my favorite moment
  was when I returned to find my unicorn friend a second time (after having
  restarted).  The process was the opposite of the original, ceremonious
  encounter: it was immediately shot down from the sky and abruptly landed on
  the ground.  To save the player some time, according to Mugenmidget.

  There are a few puzzles in Noname.  Some are rewarding, and others are
  frustrating.  After bragging about being able to obtain a particular
  hamburger (pictured below), I have returned to the game to find that I'm not
  quite sure how I did it!

<p>
  Over-all, the constant variety of the game justifies its rough spots.  Noname
  leaves you feeling as if you've actually gone somewhere and seen new things,
  a rare quality that escapes most game designers.

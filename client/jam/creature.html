Mania!  Betrayal!  Deliverance!

<p>
If I'm honest, I wasn't that excited to play Willy Wonder's Creature Creator.
I played it for a few minutes after receiving it and it seemed like a toy for
small children.  I finished piecing together my third creature and quit the
game to do something more interesting.  I let it sit on my hard drive for
the rest of the week.

Parts of it, like the cute, child-made creature request forms, did have a lot
of heart.  The concept was certainly creative and interesting...  for children.
I was pleased with the game, but at a distance.

No!  Creature Creator quickly becomes an intense, story-driven thriller.
Having waited a week to revisit it, as well as not having known PStart before
the jam, the first plot twist was very shocking for me.

<p>
Now, having seen the perverse fate of my creatures, the comic-but-inspiring
run into the sunset, the bloody hands of my protagonist, I find Creature
Creator to be far more exciting, emotional, and heartfelt than its taciturn
beginnings suggest.

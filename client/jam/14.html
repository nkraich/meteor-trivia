14 is an erie journey into your new job as a data retrieval agent.  Your aim
is to collect (but never edit) files for your employer and its clients.  To do
this, you must traverse a number different stages (14 if you're keeping count),
solving puzzles to break the protections around the data file in each level.

<p>
The game takes the concept of decrypting files and gives it a concrete
expression in a familiar, platform-game world.  The analogy is accurate enough
to be meaningful, but simple enough to be easily understood, allowing for
enjoyable gameplay that stands on its own.

<p>
The puzzles create a satisfying, adventurous feeling of hacking into a system.
The difficulty is just right, allowing many quick wins and an increasing sense
of mastery over the environment.  Near the end, you may find yourself believing
that you are something of a real computer hacker!  And, if you are truly as
clever as you imagine during the game, you may parlay this into an alternate
ending that is far more rewarding than what the average player will experience.

<p>
The crowning feature of 14 is its conclusion.  If you are attentive and
curious, you will find yourself in the grips of this ultimate challenge.  Your
final computer hack pulls you, the player, directly into the narrative,
sweating as you sit at your keyboard, awaiting impending retribution for your
actions.

      <ol>
        <li>Starts on the afternoon/night of Friday, March 7th at 21:00 GMT.</li>
        <li>Will continue for 7 days until Saturday, March 15th at 0:00 GMT.</li>
        <li>Games will be judged over the following weekend.</li>
        <li>No hard rules for entries.  The idea is to catch up and have fun
        with K&amp;Pers while working on a game &mdash; just like old times
        in #K&amp;P.</li>
        <li>Extra points for using a Clickteam product, although you're free
        to use whatever tools/language you'd like.  Double extra points for
        using
        <a href="http://knpforschools.webs.com" target="_blank">K&amp;P</a>!
        </li>
        <li>There will be a theme that is incorporated into all games.  This
        will be announced at the start of the jam.
        </li>
        <li>Submitted games will be reviewed and made available for download
        on the <a href="/games">Games</a> page.</li>
        <li>Please post pictures of your game or screenshots of K&amp;P,
        TGF, C&amp;C, MMF, etc. on <a href="/wall">The Wall</a> as you're
        working!  This will add to the fun.  :)</li>
        <li>Funâ„¢ <em>will be experienced</em> by all participants.</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p style="text-align:center">The theme is <b>Surprise Endings</b>:</p>
    <p>
      This might be an unusual, shocking, or unique ending to your game.  It
      doesn't have to be elaborate, just surprising in some small (or big) way!
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: Please make it relatively easy to come to the ending, or provide
      some sort of shortcut to it so that it's reasonably easy to review it.

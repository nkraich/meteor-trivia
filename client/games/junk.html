  Junk opens with a call to a waste removal operation known as Clean Bear
  Junk Removal.  On one end of the line is our hardened, glassy-eyed, koala
  bear protagonist with a business to run.  On the other is mean-spirited man
  who wants to destroy his children's gifts.  Because he hates them.  The
  children, not the gifts.

  The bear doesn't talk much.  He gets to work.
</p>

<p>
  In order to clear each stage, you must bounce a ball back and forth,
  destroying all of the blocks as you go.  The gameplay is very similar
  to Breakout, however, a third dimension has been added, and the ball may
  bounce over a block, or there may be blocks on higher levels that you must
  attack.  This adds an interesting twist to the familiar gameplay.

  Where Junk really shines is in the artwork, presentation, and technical
  detail.  The introductory screens are polished and well timed.  A custom
  text printer presents dialog on the screen with pauses in just the right
  places.  The in-game engine, particularly the 2.5D physics, is well-crafted
  and solid.  The artwork is detailed and purposeful, creating complex,
  memorable characters in only a few frames.

<p>
  All of these elements combine to form a game that projects a big personality.
  With fun gameplay and a funny twist at the end, Junk is a satisfying,
  complete experience.

<p>
Fourilla by CloakBass is a physics-centric, co-op game where multiple players
attempt to control a single character on screen together, in the vein of QWOP.
Fourilla ups the ante by doubling the number of controls, potentially enabling
up to 4 players to cooperate together.

Unforunately, I was unable to get a group of people together to test this.  But
it's clear that the chaos in participating with a group makes Fourilla an
extremely fun activity for a party or get-together.

I did manage to operate two of the gorilla's feet enough to hobble along the
course.  Eventually, I got into a sort of roll and tumbled through the stage.

Fourilla provides a number of obstacles to climb over which add some challenge
and rewarding variety to the trek.  At the end, you find yourself bouncing down
into a large success pit.

<p>
While a little lacking in its presentation, Fourilla is an excellent
technical and creative achievement.  It provides everything you need to
experience crushing dysfunction and, if you put in the effort, glorious
success, with friends.

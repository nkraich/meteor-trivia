  Cookie Castle is a race to clean up a castle that houses some extremely
  messy, perhaps even inconsiderate, occupants.  As they create swarms
  of bouncing junk in the many levels of the castle, you rush to clean
  up by running and jumping into the items and also by moving up and down
  the floors.  The main character is controlled using the arrow keys: left and
  right to walk, up to jump, up and down to change floors.

  Once you get the hang of the objective, Cookie Castle provides some pretty
  enjoyable gameplay.  You often have to decide which floor you will attempt
  to clean up, and whether you should leave a floor unfinished to tend to
  another one.  Colliding with a piece of junk is not always easy and can
  take some well timed running and jumping.

  The player's natural instinct is to clean as quickly as possible to complete
  within the time windows of the two stages of the game.  However, the game
  does not appear to reward or penalize for finishing early or late; this
  would have added a clear challenge to a game that is otherwise lacking one.

  As it is, it seems fairly easy to win the praise of the inhabitants.  You
  don't even have to finish.  The surprise ending seems to be that they
  appreciate your work!  Anyone who's ever kept house will enjoy the humor.

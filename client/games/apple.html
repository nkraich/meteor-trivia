Apple Ball is my own creation, so this will just be a brief description with a
few screenshots.

<p>
The object of the game is to pass all of the 20 stages by launching the apple
ball into the basket, bouncing off of walls, ramps, and floors to do so.  The
catch is that you must repeat a shot made by the computer, bouncing off of
the same places that it does and doing so in the same order.
</p>

<p>
There are four modes, each with 5 levels.  You have 3 lives to complete the
levels in a mode before you must restart it.  Your progress is saved after
each 5 level set.

<p>
Complete all 20 levels and you will find the surprise ending where, as Cald
predicted, the ball turns into...  something.

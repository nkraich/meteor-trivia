<p>
  You start on a ship lost at sea.  As you attempt to find land, strange
  messages simulatenously give you direction and prophecy your doom.  Is there
  a chance of survival?

<p>
  Bear Cave is 1-part hopeless sailing and 1-part hopeless exploration in the
  depths of a bear cave.  Throughout, your life seems to be in constant
  jeopardy.  And nagging at the back of your mind is the question: Is it even
  <em>possible</em> to win this game?

<p>
  The game often has you turned around, second-guessing your direction
  and wondering if you've been moving in circles.  This confusion is Bear
  Cave's true test in what would otherwise be a very straightforward
  challenge.  Rather than battle monsters or solve in-game puzzles, you must
  wage war against your own self-doubt.
</p>

<p>
  The game's poetic discouragements, limited visibility and over-all
  psychological challenge set it apart as a demanding, reflective
  experience.

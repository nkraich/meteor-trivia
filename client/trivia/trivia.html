    <p>Hey there!  The quiz runs every 2 weeks on Saturday.  Come back and
    join us when we're all here.  :)</p>
    <p>Last week's winner was <b>Zenith</b>!</p>
    <p>Nash won the "identify this game" round.</p>
    <p>Nim won a round with a bunch of his own questions.</p>
    <p>Terrible fake prizes were "distributed".</p>
    <p>See you next time on Saturday, March 8th at 16:30 GMT.  (The game jam
    will also be going on then!)</p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      Rules:
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone sees the same question at once.  You have 60 seconds to answer
      each question.  The number of questions in each round will be announced
      in the chat, along with the horrible prize (tm) that the winner will
      receive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Answering questions sooner earns you more points:
    </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Within 10 seconds &mdash; 50 points</li>
      <li>Within 20 seconds &mdash; 40 points</li>
      <li>Within 35 seconds &mdash; 25 points</li>
      <li>Within 50 seconds &mdash; 10 points</li>
      <li>Within 60 seconds &mdash; 5 points</li>
    </ul>
